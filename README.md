## Hyperskill problems
During each project, various code problems are included between each stage.      
https://github.com/drtierney/hyperskill-problems  

## Simple Chatty Bot
A simple bot that will help you in your learning and make it more fun.

## Hangman
Hangman is a popular yet grim puzzle game. A cruel computer hides a word from you, which you try to guess letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be “hanged”. If you win, you'll survive. You’ve probably played the game at least once or twice. Now you can actually create this game yourself!

## Markdown Editor
Markdown is a special plain text formatting language that is extremely popular among developers. It is used in documents, research articles, Github README files, and other things. In this project, you will write an editor that will be able to recognize several tags, structures, and save your results to a file.

## Currency Converter
Want to convert one currency to another? You can go to your bank website and do the math by yourself. Or you can write a program to do it quickly and efficiently! The Currency Converter is a simple console program that calculates the amount of money you get by converting one currency to another.

## Zookeeper
This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

## Web Scraper
You will create a function that takes a website address and a number of webpages as input arguments and then goes all over the website saving every news article on the page to a separate .txt file on your computer.

## Coffee Machine
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## Tic Tac Toe
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

## Dominoes
Have you ever wanted to code a game where the computer is your enemy? Well, this little project allows you to do just that. Take turns playing classic dominoes against your computer in a race to victory. Learn, how artificial intelligence can make use of simple statistics to make educated decisions. This project is all about basic concepts, put them to practice by making a fun little game.

## Duplicate File Handler
Duplicate File Handler is a useful tool that can free some space on your drive. Write a handler that checks and compares files in a folder, displays the result, and removes duplicates.

## Data Analysis for Hospitals
You know the story. Data is everywhere: texts, images, news, spreadsheets. Data determines our habits and future. The amount of data is growing by the second. Data analysis is good for any line of business. How to stay afloat in this great water of data? In this project, you will conduct a comprehensive study with pandas. Upload datasets, deal with data omissions and incorrect data filling, find the main statistical characteristics, and visualize your data. Let's do it!

## Food Blog Backend
You will create a simple backend that will allow you to populate an SQLite3 database. You will know how to deal with the primary key auto-increment and how to use foreign keys to create relationships between the tables. Learn how to deal with many-to-many relations. Work with SQL queries and database cursor methods.

## Easy Rider Bus Company (On Hold)
In addition to writing your own programs to test data consistency and correctness, you will practice reading documentation, working with data in JSON format, and creating lists and dictionaries. You will also learn how to work with set methods and regular expression library.  
https://github.com/drtierney/hyperskill-EasyRiderBusCompany-Python  

https://hyperskill.org/projects/128  

## Bill Splitter (In Progress)
Work on your Python basics and take a look at more advanced data structures such as dictionaries. Develop an app for managing expenses during your next dine-out.
